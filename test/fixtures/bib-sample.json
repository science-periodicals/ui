  "description": "We analyzed a database of mammal-virus associations to ask whether zoonotic disease surveillance targeting diseased animals is the best strategy to identify potentially zoonotic pathogens. Though a mixed healthy and diseased surveillance strategy is generally best, surveillance of apparently healthy bats and rodents would likely maximize discovery potential for most zoonotic viruses.",

Probabilities are based on the predicted values of the logistic regression and are given on a five-point gray scale from white (0.0 – 0.2) to black (0.8 - 1.0). Confidence values were calculated as the coefficient plus 1.96 times the standard error (from Table 1).",
